Feeds
=====

Google Reader for GNOME.

__WARNING__: This application is still in develovepment.
You can already use it for your daily reading needs, but `gtk3` still gets
into not-working state once in a while.

Goals
-----

Goal is to provide pleasant, clean and integrated reading experience.
Replicating full Google Reader functionality (e.g. feed management â€“ you can
subscribe, but there's no way to effectively manage your subscribtions yet)
is only a secondary goal.

Timeline and descriptions can be found at
[milestones](https://github.com/simukis/Feeds/issues/milestones) page.
